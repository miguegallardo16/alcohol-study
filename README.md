# alcohol-study
In this repository we have studied the data obtained for each country on alcohol consumption as well as another series of attributes which may be correlated.

The variable names and descriptions are the following:

- country: Unique Identifier
- incomeperperson: Gross Domestic Product per capita in constant 2000 US$. The inflation but not the differences in the cost of living between countries has been taken into account.
- alcconsumption: Alcohol consumption per adult (age 15+), litres Recorded and estimated average alcohol consumption, adult (15+) per capita consumption in litres pure alcohol
- suicideper100TH: Suicide, age adjusted, per 100 000 Mortality due to self-inflicted injury, per 100 000 standard population, age adjusted
- employrate: Total employees age 15+ (% of population) Percentage of total population, age above 15, that has been employed during the given year.
- urbanrate: Urban population (% of total) Urban population refers to people living in urban areas as defined by national statistical offices (calculated using World Bank population estimates and urban ratios from the United Nations World Urbanization Prospects)

As we have been able to see in the project, it has been concluded that alcohol consumption and the percentage of suicides are correlated with each other, we have also observed a small relationship with the capital power of these countries where these values were higher.
